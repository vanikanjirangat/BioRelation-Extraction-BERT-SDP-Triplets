# BioRelation_Extraction_BioBERT_SDP
Biomedical Relation Extraction by enhancing the tranformer models reducing the noisy samples utilizing shortes dependency features (SDP).

# Data Generation: Removing Nosiy Data with SDP Information
Gen_data_CDR.py-- script to generate the train, dev and test sets for CDR dataset

These scripts in turn utilizes the scispacy_parse_intra.py and scispacy_parse_pair.py.
scispacy_parse_intra.py-- SDP comptation for intra-sentential relations
scispacy_parse_pair.py--SDP comptation for inter-sentential relations

# Data Generation: WIthout SDP Information
Gen_data_random_CDR--script to generate the train, dev and test sets for CDR dataset without SDP

# Training the Model and Predictions
You have to download the pretrained model files for BioBert from https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert and convert the checkpoints using the instructions in https://huggingface.co/transformers/converting_tensorflow_models.html and store them.
cdr_bio_pair_sdp_transformers.py: The script utilizes the data generated by Gen_data_CDR.py and and fine tune the BioBERT model.
The paths of input directory, the model path and output directory must be set properly. CHEMPROT evaluations can be done similarily just changing the # of labels  accordingly. For Chemprot (#  of labels=6).
